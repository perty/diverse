<h1>Prelude</h1>
<p>The sun is shining over the little village and the farmers are
plowing. A logger comes out of the woods on his way to the storage bin
with his load.</p>
<p>A sudden sound of something big crashing into something even
bigger sounds across the sky. The birds stops singing and everyone
freezes. A second passes, then they all start waving. "Help!", they
mean, "It is the black elves that are coming!".</p>
<p>You have to quickly find an action or the whole population might
be swept away by storming black elves. <i>The tar pit, get some tar!
Put it in the dry grass!</i></p>
<p>When the black ones are storming in, you give the command to
light a fire in the grass and set them into panic. Those that are not
consumed by the fire, retreat to their ship. A few break through but are
killed swiftly by brave villagers equipped with shovels.</p>
<p>The villagers cheer as the cracking noise from the ship signals
its leaving. The victory was not only a relief but the villagers had
also added a new maneuver to their tactics, use fire to stop black
elves.</p>
<p>However, the next attack might not be as easy handled. Also,
there still may be black elves left on your island and if you do not
deal with them, they will deal with you as soon as they have rested long
enough.</p>
<p>To search the island efficiently, you need horses, so you command
a villager to tame some of the wild ones on the island. Meanwhile, you
organize a search party with a few good men.</p>
<p>The horses arrive and you send the search party out. Eventually
they find a small group of black elves that is gathering strength for a
new attack. Extinguishing them led to another skill for your village,
after an attack, send out a party to wipe out remaining enemies.</p>
<h1>Islands - an Online Game of Strategy</h1>
<p>You village is the sole village on an island that floats in an
eternal sea. Once in a while, the island will be attacked by black elves
that wish to take you resources and kidnap your people for sacrifice.</p>
<p>It will also happen, that your island will bump into another,
similar island. Friend or foe, it can not be known until the very last
moment.</p>
<p>As you island develops, it will be come larger in size and your
population increase. Also, new technologies and strategies become known,
making it possible to handle more difficult situations and stronger
foes.</p>
<p>When you log out, life goes on in your village and as you return,
things that has passed are to be read in the history book of your
island. It may have gone well or it may have gone bad.</p>
<p>Since you can not attend to the island always, the better you can
prepare your inhabitants, the better they will do when you are away.</p>
<p>It is your challenge to balance the expansion of your village
against the available resources. You must balance a strong military
force against a thriving civilian life.</p>
<p>You will form or join groups of islands that become a lot
stronger against the attacks from the black elves and other, hostile
islands.</p>
<h2>Home Page</h2>
<p>Every island has a home page on the web. Here the current state
of the island and a picture of the island can be seen. Also, you have an
avatar on the web and in the game which carries jewelry and other things
that express your status.</p>
